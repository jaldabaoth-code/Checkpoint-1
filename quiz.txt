- 1 - Use a descriptive and meaningful name: The name of a class should clearly and accurately describe the purpose or role of the class. It should be easy to understand and should provide context for the code.
- 2 - Use mixed case with the first letter of each word capitalized: In Java, it is common to use mixed case with the first letter of each word capitalized, also known as "camel case," for class names. For example, MyClass or EmployeeRecord.
- 3 - Use nouns or noun phrases: Class names should typically be nouns or noun phrases that describe the objects or entities that the class represents. For example, Person, BankAccount, or PaymentProcessor.
- 4 - Avoid using abbreviations or acronyms: It is generally a good idea to avoid using abbreviations or acronyms in class names, unless they are well-known and commonly used in the context of your program. Using abbreviations or acronyms can make your code harder to read and understand.
